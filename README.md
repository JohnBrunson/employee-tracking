# Employee Tracking

## Description

In order to learn more about databases, I've constructed a simple TUI based company database for employee tracking. This could solve the problem for a small business to keep track of their employees and possibly be useful to build a more robust front end to show things like the organization structure of the small business. Postgre SQL is what is used for the database.
